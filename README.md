# calcAR
literally just a script to help me figure out the size of a 4:3 window to make it's edge line up with a 16:9 window. Dumb simple but I'm tired of the math

### Usage:
I made an iOS shortcut which prompts the user for input and runs the command over ssh. Then I add this shortcut in control center for easy access. Look at shortcut.jpg for shortcut details.
